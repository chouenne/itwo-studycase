                                            instance, during a recent project, a client initially approved a design but
                                            later decided to revert to a previous version. Having a comprehensive

                <div class="learned-flex">
                    <div class="left-text">
                        <p><strong>Improved Product Thinking:</strong> This project deepened my understanding that
                            effective design extends beyond aesthetics to align with business goals. Initially, CTAs
                            were designed without a clear strategy, which limited their effectiveness. Through analysis
                            of conversion metrics and a shift in perspective from a purely client-centric approach to a
                            more business-centric approach, we recognized the critical role of CTA optimization.</p>

                        <p>We focused on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visibility: Ensuring CTAs were prominently placed and easily visible by using
                                contrasting colors and strategic placement.</li>
                            <li>Text and Design: Implementing clear, action-oriented text (e.g., "start a consultation"
                                "contact us") and design elements that made CTAs stand out.</li>
                            <li>A/B Testing: Testing different CTA designs, texts, and placements to identify the most
                                effective variations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By optimizing CTAs, we improved user engagement and conversion rates, directly supporting the
                            client’s business objectives. This experience reinforced the value of integrating user
                            experience improvements with strategic business goals to enhance both client satisfaction
                            and overall project success.

                <!-- <ol>
                    <li>
                        Improved Product Thinking: This project helped me understand that design is not just about aesthetics but also about achieving business goals. For example, in the initial design, the "Contact Us" button in the navigation bar was treated like any other menu item. After considering conversion metrics, we decided to highlight this button to make it more prominent, improving user navigation and supporting the client’s business objectives.
                    </li>
                  <li>Teamwork and Collaboration: Throughout this project, I learned the importance of close collaboration with team members, particularly when it came to maintaining consistency in design. Our two designers worked on other pages, and we had to coordinate effectively to ensure that every page looked cohesive. This involved aligning details such as font sizes, button border ratios, and other design elements to achieve a unified appearance across the website.</li>
                  <li>Conflict Resolution Skills: During the project, I encountered a situation where one of my team members accidentally deleted sections that I had created, without a backup. While it was initially frustrating, this experience taught me the value of forgiveness and resilience. Instead of dwelling on the mistake, we shared our feelings and learned that mistakes are a part of the process. A strong team needs to be inclusive, supportive, and understanding of each other's errors to move forward effectively.</li>
                  <li>Balancing Client Preferences and User-Centered Design: Another key lesson was understanding how to balance my design vision with the client's preferences. For example, the client insisted on retaining the previous website's footer, which featured a triangular graphic, despite the rest of the site using rounded graphics. While I provided suggestions, I ultimately respected the client's wishes, as it is their website. This experience reinforced the importance of being user-centered and knowing when to compromise to meet client needs.</li>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The redesigned i2 Wealth website was successfully launched after two months of development. The
                        client was highly satisfied with the new look, functionality, and improved user engagement,
                        which led to clearer communication of their services. As a result, our team continued to work
                        with the client, maintaining the website by debugging and ensuring it remained in top condition.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project taught me the importance of collaboration in a team setting, and it solidified my
                        skills in both web design and development. Managing multiple responsibilities, from design to
                        development, allowed me to grow as a versatile web designer, and the experience of working
                        closely with a team contributed to my ability to deliver high-quality work.</p>
